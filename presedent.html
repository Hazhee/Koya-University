                            <p>Dears colleagues,<br><br> Developing a vision for an academic institution, such as a
                                university needs to be based on knowledge about the actual general conditions of the
                                university, on the one hand, and its capacity to enhance the scientific level on the
                                other in order to make impact on the social background from which it has emerged, and
                                which demands it to play an effective role in changing the conditions for the better.
                                Our vision stems from our desire that Koya University will be able to dream of a big
                                process of scientific change, and to have a role in developing an advanced scientific
                                programme at the level of Kurdistan Region, and to become a reliable source. <br> <br>

                                Here, I try, in the following points, to outline the steps, which I assume will be
                                helpful in achieving this vision: <br><br>

                                I will work for the scientific, administrative and financial independence of the
                                university and for making it responsible for making its own decisions by working closely
                                with the staff members of the Ministry Council and the Koya University teaching staff.
                                <br>
                                It is in my plan to work towards translating the name of the Ministry of Higher
                                Education and Scientific Research into action where Koya University can take practical
                                steps forward in terms of both high quality education and research. <br>
                                In my opinion, a successful university is one where all the staff members work together
                                as one team each complementing the other. Therefore, nobody should be left out or
                                excluded from participating in carrying out the important cultural mission carried by
                                the university; this can only succeed when the active staff members get credit for their
                                achievements in order to continue and the others are encouraged to follow their example
                                and also by developing a spirit of free and healthy competition. <br>
                                I consider it a task and a responsibility to maintain the current ranking of Koya
                                University as the fifth among the Iraqi Kurdistan Region's universities, and to make
                                attempts to enhance it more not only at the level of the Kurdistan Region and Iraq but
                                at the global level as well. To this end, I will try to improve and strengthen the
                                academic relations with the outside world. <br>
                                My plan and programme will be to make Koya University have an effective and practical
                                role in advancing Koya town and the areas around it and in developing ideas and
                                conducting scientific research to tackle the different problems; and to enable the
                                university to contribute to the strategic plans of the region according to scientific
                                standards. In line with this, it is in my plan to pay attention to and develop
                                scientific research centers provided with the necessary resources to meet the demands of
                                the researchers so that their effective role in decision making will be apparent and
                                they will be able to encompass and develop the scientific innovations of the researchers
                                and to have a role in guiding and publishing the university teachers' researches in the
                                advanced scientific journals of the world. <br>
                                In the near future, I will be working on two issues with the members of the University
                                Council and the scientific staff, and these issues are: first, expanding the university
                                through opening and renovating the scientific departments, including opening special
                                departments where all the subjects in all academic years will be studied in English
                                according to world standards in an attempt to practically link Koya University with all
                                the nations of the world. The second issue will be planning and implementing a feasible
                                programme for language learning, including Kurdish language for the foreign and
                                non-Kurdish staff of Koya University and English for the university staff and cadres so
                                that we will not be cut off from the science and knowledge of the world. <br>
                                I will try to put the principle of 'Long Live Learning' into its true shape so that the
                                university can gradually plan programmes in this direction. This can be done through
                                creating stage-by-stage parallel and paid education opportunities with taking the
                                students' financial situation into consideration. <br>
                                Within the same vision, I request that, in addition to Bachelor's, Master's and
                                Doctorate degrees, the university should award a Higher Diploma degree in some
                                specializations in order to improve the capacity of those who want to join courses in
                                some special expertise and obtain certificates; along with this, there has to be
                                short-term and long-term courses for certain issues and topics. <br>
                                I also unify my efforts with those of the active staff members of the university,
                                consultants and members of the Council of the Ministry of Higher Education and
                                Scientific research to make attempts to gain legal, financial etc. authority for the
                                university in order to be able to monitor and follow up the university graduates for
                                some years after graduation in order to be confident about their capacity and level of
                                progress and to make sure that they will find work after completing their university
                                education. <br>
                                I will be working to build the teachers' capacity in a way that they will not only focus
                                their identity on teaching, but to become well-known scientific researchers and experts
                                through opening scientific capacity building courses for them and delegating them so
                                that they will become familiarized with the experience of their peers in the advanced
                                universities of the world. <br>
                                I will be working on activating the role of students within the university so that they
                                will not only be passive receivers of science and knowledge and considered as
                                unqualified certificate holders, but as productive individuals contributing to the
                                scientific and educational process; moreover, the university should become a place for
                                nurturing their capacities and personal interests, and for strengthening their
                                personalities intellectually so that they will not become easy targets for unusual and
                                unhealthy trends and so that their abilities will not be negatively exploited. We want
                                them to be active members able to use their university education and learning to play a
                                role in making and directing the public opinion in their communities. <br>
                                In all the above activities and programmes, quality assurance will remain an ongoing and
                                steady process and we will work on removing the constraints and obstacles that hinder
                                enhancing its continuity and efficiency. <br> <br> <br><b> Yours Sincerely; <br>
